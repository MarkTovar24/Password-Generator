# Password Generator

## What I started with:
- Simple starter Javascript code that barely has any function
- Full HTML structure
- Full CSS Styling

## What I was asked of:
- To create a password generator
- Give the user the ability to select parameters for the password

## Password Parameters:
- Character amount
- Upper/Lowercase letters
- Numeric characters
- Special characters

## What can this be used for?
- Any piece of sensitive data needs a password
- Some passwords are easy to guess
- Using a randomly generated password ensures your data will be kept safe
